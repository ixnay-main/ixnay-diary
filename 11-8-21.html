    <h2>On Craig</h2>
    <hr>
   Craig is a dude, he lives my life through. Once he lives my life he goes and lives yours, and then anther persons. Disregard time. Craig just plays out each of our existances, we are all craig. <br>
   <br>
   But whatever craig builds he gets to use in the next life. If craig does the dishes when playing me, then he wont need to do them when playing you. <br><br>
   The purpose of life is to build tools. Craig shouldnt be hindered by himself because he didnt build enough, that hurts to see. Build, Build, Build.
    <br><br>
