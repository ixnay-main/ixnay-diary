    <h2>The premise</h2>
    <hr>
    Luke doesnt have a local store. No supermarket, no Lowe's, no home depot. He hasnt even got a road. <br>
    Think through what would happen if C3PO were to break, but indulge in the details and whip up some futuristic possibilities. I see C3PO telling Luke that somthing is up. C3PO has a register of his parts, their OS, Spec, Size, Mechanical properties, allowances ... The problem doesnt need to be diagnosed, just replaced. Luke hops on his terminal and inputs the part. Its delivered by drone and he plugs it into C3PO. What happens inbetween? Data was send to their closest possible fixer of the part. Maybe they didnt have the facilities. Maybe Luke is a man with unusual ethical requirements about conditions on the workshops that are delegated his contract. It doesnt really matter. Input of problem came back with and output of a solution - this is really the meaning of tech. 

    <br><br>

    Hopefully i painted a basic picture of a distributed delivery system. You have a spare printer? It'll turn itself on and start whipping somthing up. A drone comes and finds it beside the print bed. Finito. Theres payment in your wallet.

    Two communities make use of additive manufacture on the day to day. They're weird.

    <br><br>

    The maker community are largely fools. Thats fine. Finding them is easy, they flag themselves by larping in costumes. Makes it simple to keep your distance. One of the reasons their creativity and industry (for lack of a better word) hasnt given the wider population ANY benefit is that the printer, cnc, sewing machine they use is really a node. A singular node sitting on their desk. Weak, small, unconnected nodes have no use to anyone. But they change the world at scale. Who says the wacko makers printer only prints bat-man ears. It's spare capacity should be used for printing his neighbors chopping boarch or chainsaw casing.

    <br><br>

    And the 3d printed gun community who find themselves scooting away (and vice versa for difference reasons) from the larpers. Larpers dont share the productive potential of a network of their machinary. The gun community is much better at making sure that my printer, which is a different spec, can work for your design - so on and so forth. The nodes in the gun community are acting as a network. Not isolated in production then joined together in the conference hall like the makers.

    <br><br>

    I think theres more to this axis between costume larpers and militia men. Maybe they will be reoccuring characters - but for now just remeber that optimal nodes use other nodes to strengthen themselves aswell as to connect to oneanother

    <h2>The Job</h2>
    <hr>

    Connect the printers. Not just for production tasks, but for R and D too, and also infrastructure upgrates - 3d print the drone a new blade it can get on its pick-up. Who says Lukes drone wont shit the bed on the way to his house... Brilliant networks self repair.
